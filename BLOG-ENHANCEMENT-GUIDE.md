- Lost productivity: $X per employee per month

(Continue for all 5 mistakes)

#### 2. Create Before/After Scenarios
For each mistake, show:
```
BEFORE (Mistake): Tried to automate 5 workflows at once
- Overwhelming team
- Multiple failures
- Lost confidence in AI
- Wasted budget

AFTER (Correct Approach): Started with 1 high-impact workflow
- Quick win builds confidence
- Team sees value immediately
- Easier to scale
- Budget confidence for expansion
```

#### 3. Add Implementation Timeline

4. Plan for team change management
5. Set realistic success metrics
6. Plan for ongoing optimization
```

Q: How long should AI implementation take?
A: Most implementations take 60-90 days to show meaningful ROI. Give AI solutions time to prove value before concluding it's not working.

Q: Can we implement AI ourselves?
A: You can, but many companies underestimate complexity. Common issues include underestimating team training needs, underestimating integration challenges, and not having processes documented clearly enough for AI systems.
